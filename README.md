# CSS Full width Header, Footer and Content ares with centered content - now responsive!

A one page example of how to create sections of the site with full width backgrounds (color, images, etc can be used), where the content is centered.

This is based off some older examples I provided on CSSgirl which where *not* responsive and contained fixed widths and didn't work when zooming.

# CSS Fixed Position Header and Footer!

The fixed-full-width folder contains and example of the same technique as above, only the header and footer will always be "sticky" to the top and bottom of the window.
